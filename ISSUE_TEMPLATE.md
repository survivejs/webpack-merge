1. Check the version of **webpack-merge** you are using. If it's not the newest version, update and try again (see changelog while updating!).
2. If the issue is still there, write a minimal script showing the problem and expected output. You can also set up a repository (even better).
3. Include the script to the issue. Mention Node version and OS in your report.
